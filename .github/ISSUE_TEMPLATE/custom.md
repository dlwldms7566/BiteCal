Summary
Add a feature to log and track water intake for BiteCal users.

Current Behavior
BiteCal currently allows users to log meals and view dietary insights, but there is no functionality to track water intake. Users who want to monitor hydration must use external apps or manual methods.

Proposed Change
Introduce a water intake tracking feature with the following enhancements:

A new section on the meal logging page to log water intake in milliliters or ounces.
A daily water intake goal customizable by the user.
A visual progress bar on the dashboard to show how much of the goal has been achieved.
Weekly hydration trends in the "Weekly Insights" page.
Benefits

Complements existing meal logging by providing a holistic view of health and hydration.
Encourages users to maintain adequate hydration, promoting overall well-being.
Aligns with BiteCal’s goal of helping users make healthier lifestyle choices.
Challenges

May require additional database fields and APIs to store and retrieve water intake data.
Designing a user-friendly interface for water tracking without overwhelming the dashboard.
Additional Context or Resources
