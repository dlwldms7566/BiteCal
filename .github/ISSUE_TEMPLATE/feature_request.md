## ðŸš€ Feature Request: Add Water Intake Tracking

**Description**
As a user, I want to log my daily water intake in BiteCal so that I can monitor my hydration levels alongside my dietary habits.

**Why is this feature important?**
- Tracking water intake complements meal logging by offering a more comprehensive view of dietary and hydration habits.
- Many users aim to improve both nutrition and hydration for better overall health.
- This feature could help users meet their daily hydration goals, which is a critical component of a healthy lifestyle.

**Proposed Solution**
1. Add a section to the meal logging interface to log water intake in milliliters or ounces.
2. Display a daily progress bar or chart showing water intake relative to a customizable daily goal.
3. Include reminders for users to log their water intake at regular intervals.

**Additional Context**
- This feature aligns with BiteCal's mission to provide valuable insights for healthier food choices and lifestyle habits.
- Competitor apps such as MyFitnessPal and WaterMinder have similar features, but integrating it into BiteCal would streamline the user experience.

**Are you willing to work on this feature?**
[ ] Yes  
[ ] No
