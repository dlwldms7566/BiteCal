Security Policy for BiteCal


Reporting a Vulnerability
Thank you for helping to make BiteCal secure! We take the security of our project seriously and value the contributions of the community to identify and report potential vulnerabilities. Please follow the steps below if you discover a security issue.


1. Report the Vulnerability Privately
If you have found a security vulnerability, do not disclose it publicly. Instead, please send an email to our security team at security@bitecal.com. Your email should include:

-A detailed description of the vulnerability
-Steps to reproduce the issue
-Any relevant screenshots or logs to support your findings


2. Response Time
Our security team is committed to responding to security vulnerability reports within 48 hours. We aim to investigate and confirm the issue within 5 business days. During this period, we may reach out to you for further information.


3. Handling the Fix
Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on developing a fix as quickly as possible. Our standard procedure involves:

-Assessing the vulnerability's impact
-Developing a patch and testing it thoroughly
-Coordinating a public release to address the issue


4. Disclosure Policy
After the vulnerability is resolved, we will publish a security advisory to inform the community. We will credit the person(s) who reported the vulnerability, unless they wish to remain anonymous.

Important Notes
-Do not open a public issue on GitHub to report security vulnerabilities. Always use the private email method to prevent potential risks until the issue is resolved.
-For general issues and bug reports that are not security-related, please use the GitHub Issues page.

Thank you for helping us maintain a secure environment for all BiteCal users. Your contribution to security is invaluable to our community.
