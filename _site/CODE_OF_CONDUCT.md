# BiteCal Code of Conduct

Welcome to BiteCal! Our goal is to create an inclusive and respectful environment where everyone can contribute meaningfully. This Code of Conduct outlines the values and behaviors expected of all participants in our project.

## Our Core Principles

1. **Respect** - Differences in opinion are natural. Please respect all perspectives.
2. **Constructive Feedback** - Offer feedback in a way that helps others grow.
3. **Kindness and Encouragement** - Treat everyone kindly and encourage new ideas and experimentation.
4. **Share Issues, Solve Together** - Share issues openly, and let’s work together to find solutions.
5. **Inclusivity** - We welcome everyone, regardless of background, nationality, gender, or experience.

## Expected Behaviors

- Show respect and courtesy in all interactions.
- Listen actively, valuing both technical and non-technical contributions.
- Share challenges and work together on solutions.
- Recognize and celebrate others’ contributions and efforts.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

- **Personal attacks, discrimination, harassment**: These will not be tolerated.
- **Disruptive or uncooperative behavior**: Criticism should be constructive and not purely negative.
- **Withholding information or monopolizing resources**: Avoid exclusive control of knowledge or decision-making.

## How to Handle Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that doesn’t align with this Code of Conduct, please take the following steps:

1. **Address the issue directly** - Minor misunderstandings can often be resolved with polite, direct conversation.
2. **Contact project maintainers** - If the issue persists or feels unresolvable, reach out to the maintainers for support.
