Technical Overview
===================

**BiteCal** is built to provide a seamless experience for tracking and evaluating meals. This section provides an overview of the system architecture, key components, and the technologies used to develop the application.

---

## **1. System Architecture**

BiteCal follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to log meals, track progress, and rate their food. It is a web-based application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The frontend communicates with the backend through API calls to fetch and send data.
  
- **Backend**: The backend handles data processing, user authentication, and serves API endpoints. It is built using **Python** with the **Flask** framework. The backend ensures that meal data is stored, retrieved, and analyzed efficiently.

- **Database**: All user data, including meal logs, ratings, and progress insights, are stored in a **relational database** (e.g., **SQLite** or **PostgreSQL**). The database is structured to handle multiple users and large sets of meal data.

- **APIs**: The backend exposes RESTful APIs for meal logging, rating, and retrieving insights. The API allows the frontend to interact with the server and perform actions like logging meals, fetching progress, and rating meals.

## **2. Core Components**

- **Meal Log**: The core feature of BiteCal is meal logging. The system stores information about meals, including meal time, ingredients, and portion sizes. The logged data is analyzed to provide insights and track eating patterns.

- **Rating System**: Users can rate their meals using a 5-star rating system. This feedback is stored in the database and is used to evaluate meal satisfaction and nutritional value over time.

---

## **3. Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue.js or vanilla JS, depending on the setup)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: SQLite (or PostgreSQL for production)
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs built using Flask
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- **Deployment**: The application can be deployed on cloud platforms such as **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**.

## **4. Future Enhancements**

Future versions of **BiteCal** plan to include:
- Integration with third-party nutritional databases for automatic meal analysis.
- Mobile application support (iOS/Android).
- Enhanced data visualization for progress insights (graphs, charts, etc.).

This overview highlights the architecture and technologies behind **BiteCal**, providing a solid foundation for understanding the application's functionality and potential for future growth.
